# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

This project provides a solution for the Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster competition on Kaggle. The goal of this competition is to create a machine learning model using the passenger data of the Titanic to predict whether or not they survived.

In this project, a machine learning model was created using Python programming language and Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Numpy libraries. The model was built using the Random Forest algorithm and various features in the dataset to predict whether or not a passenger survived.

File Structure
train.csv: Training dataset
test.csv: Test dataset
submission.csv: Prediction results to be submitted to the competition

Installation
Python 3.x
Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Numpy libraries

To run this project, Python 3.x must be installed on your machine. Then, navigate to the project folder and install the necessary libraries by running the following command:

``` pip install -U scikit-learn pandas numpy ```

Usage
To train the model and make predictions on the test dataset, navigate to the project folder and run the following command:

``` python titanic.py ```

This command will train the model, make predictions on the test dataset, and generate the submission.csv file.
